Reflections of lesson 3

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Others may be adding files to the remote. You have to make sure the pull wont break your piece of code.. manual is always safe.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are clones at github
clones, clones a repo locally 
branch is a new branch for the same repository.
