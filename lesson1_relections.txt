How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me to pin point the typo that was introduced. 

 How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
    
    It will help me to go back to an older version , if lost in between. It helps to build something different from an earlier version. A branch of code.

 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

   You can decide on when to commit. Commit for each logical change cant be automated.

 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 In software systems, logical association between files exists and tracking files together makes sense.

 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

 Since I can always go back by checking out an older commit and build a new branch from there.

 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 For source control my coding projects. To collaborate with other team members.
